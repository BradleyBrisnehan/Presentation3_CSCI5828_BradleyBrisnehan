     <h2>Introduction</h2>
     <p>
        The use of multi-layer Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) and surface mount Integrated Circuits (IC) make it difficult to probe pins during debug and production verification.  The use of IC packaging such as ball grid array make it impossible to probe and troubleshoot circuits.  Without a better debugging tool, the only option to check connections and functionality of these ICs is with X-Ray inspection which is costly and prohibitive.
     </p>
     <p>
        As BGA packages became promenant in the 1980s, the need for a better way to debug at a hardware level was required.  THe Joint Test Action Group was formed in 1985 to develop a method for testing printed circuit boards after manufacture.  The outcome of the Joint Test Action Group was documented in 1990 under IEEE (Industrial of Electrial and Electronics Engineers) standard 1149.1-1990: <i>Standard Test Access Port and Boundary-Scan Architecture</i>.
     </p>
     <p>
        JTAG / TAP introduces cells between the internal logic and the external pin connections.  In the case of the original standard, this functionality is at the expense of four pins.  Reduced pin count JTAG (as defined under IEEE 1149.7) reduces this requirement to two pins.  Beyond the use of these pins purely for debugging, JTAG / TAP connections can be extended for In-System Programming (ISP) of embedded designs.
     </p>
     <p>
        Derivatives of JTAG / TAP have permeated every hardware package; from ARM to 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers to PCI and PCI-Express connectors.  JTAG / TAP is the key to debugging and verifying many types of computer hardware.
